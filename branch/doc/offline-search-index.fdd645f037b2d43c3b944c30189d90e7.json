Make sure to download OpenPnP 2.0 for your machine. OpenPNP 2.0\n  After getting it installed, it’s time to import the default configuration for your Index. OpenPnP saves configuration files in different places depending on your operating system. This folder has a period in front of its name, meaning it’s hidden! The folder is still there, it just won’t show up in your file explorer. You might need to do something with your settings to get it to show up. If you’re on Windows, click here for instructions, and here if you’re on Mac.\n  The information below about how to find the config files directory on your computer is pulled from the OpenPnP Wiki.\n Configuration files are located in your home directory, under a subdirectory called .openpnp2.\nOn Mac this will typically be /Users/[username]/.openpnp2.\nOn Windows 2000, XP and 2003 it will be C:\\Documents and Settings[username].openpnp2.\nOn Windows Vista and above it’s C:\\Users[username].openpnp2.\nConfiguration files are in XML format and can be edited by hand in a text editor. You should shutdown OpenPnP before editing files by hand as OpenPnP will rewrite the configuration files on exit.\nThere are three primary configuration files. They are:\nmachine.xml: Contains the primary configuration for the entire system, including information about the machine, cameras, feeders, nozzles, etc.\nparts.xml: A portable parts database. As you define parts (components) in OpenPnP they are stored here.\npackages.xml: A portable packages database. Component package information including shape and dimensions are stored here.\n Once you’ve found your .openpnp2 folder, drop the machine.xml, parts.xml, and packages.xml files into it. If you already have parts and packages configured from previous usage of OpenPnP, you can just drop in the machine.xml file.\n","categories":"","description":"Install OpenPNP and import default config\n","excerpt":"Install OpenPNP and import default config\n","ref":"/branch/doc/openpnp/calibration/import-config/","tags":"","title":"Importing Config Files"},{"body":"There are five types of connectors that need to be soldered into your motherboard. We’ll go over each one, and how to solder them in place.\nScrew Terminal In your connector bag you’ll find a screw terminal connector.

The slot on the connector should match up with the silkscreen.\nTODO: picture of these locations on the board, and connectors\nJST XH Connectors The bulk of the connectors on the board are JST XH connectors. These come in two, three, and four pin variations. The two pin connectors are for the mosfets, the three pin connectors are for the servos, limit switches, and ring lights, and the four pin connectors are for the stepper motors. Be sure to solder these with the correct orientation as dictated by the silkscreen.\nTODO: pics of all this\nUSB A Connectors There are three USB A connectors that need to be soldered into the board as well. Two of these are for the webcams, and the third is for future functionality. We recommend soldering the large structural tabs in place first, then soldering the four data pins afterward.\nTODO: pics of all this\nStepper Motor Driver Headers The last connectors that need to be soldered into the board are the 1x8 Dupont 0.1\" headers for the stepper motor drivers. Two connectors need to be soldered for each driver. We recommend soldering a single pin in place first while getting the connector to stay flat, then do the rest of the pins after the orientation is solidified.

Assembly Take the Left Back Leg and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the hole into which it is inserted.    Take the Left Front Leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the Left Back Leg. Your progress should look like the image below.    On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.    On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.    Now, mount the NEMA?? stepper motor to the back left leg.

Please ensure that you’ve done some research to ensure you select the appropriate model, BOM, hardware, firmware and software combination.  To build your own index you will need to acquire the items listed on the BOM. This includes various mechanical components along with a significant number of 3D printed parts. When printing the 3d parts, be sure to print them with the recommended settings.\nTools The following tools are needed to build the Index.\n 2mm Allen Key 2.5mm Allen Key 3mm Allen Key 4mm Allen Key Fine Tip Tweezers (for positioning T-Nuts) Pliers / Vice Grips Utility Knife / Precision Blade  Tips \u0026 Tricks When assembling the Index, the following tips will help the process go more smoothly.\n Clean up your 3D prints well. Make sure that you have removed any support material, and have cleaned up the edges of any holes. Test that you can fit the V-Slot or machine screw for a specific part into the hole. Deburr the aluminum profile at the ends. Then it’s easier to put parts together. Slot Nuts come in two different formats. One form can be inserted into the slot through the slot. The other form must be inserted from the end. Watch for notes in the about when to insert based on which type you’re using. Positioning Slot Nuts can be a bit of a challenge. A simple way to get them into the right place is to use gravity to get them close, and then use either the long end an allen key or a pair of fine tipped tweezers to push or pull them to the exact position. Inserting Belts can be easier if you move the gantry you’re inserting the belt into to the middle of the rail it is on and then as you insert the belt, move it away from the side you want the belt to come out from. The v-slot will catch the belt and once you’ve moved the gantry a little bit, you will be able to catch the belt. Passing a belt through a belt slot from the inner side can be easier if you place an exacto knife blade at the back side of the slot and butt the belt against that while drawing it up through the slot. Press Fit Nuts are used in several places. If your printer tolerances make it so these nuts don’t stay in you can use a piece of tape over the back to hold them in temporarily.

This is not an absolute guarantee that the connection to the STM32 works though. Check if all solder joints look fine Check if all necessary voltages are present (Mobo input voltage, 5V rail and 3.3V rail) Keep in mind that a blank STM32 should still appear as a USB device, even if it has no firmware loaded onto it Check the 8MHz crystal oscillator of the SMT32. Its correct operation is important for DFU. Wrong frequency and / or incorrect load capacitors can cause issues. Use an oscilloscope to probe the signal. You should see a smooth sine wave with stable frequency.  Alternative method to upload: This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent). Additionally you need the software STM32CubeProgrammer by ST.

You should see something like below, lots of cables loosely attached to the front left leg, all looking for a home. We’re about to give them one!\nPlugging in We’ll first start by plugging in the Y motors you routed behind the motherboard in an earlier step. Plug the cable labeled Y1 into the left Y motor port on the motherboard, and plug the Y2 cable into the right.\nTODO(img of y cables plugged in)\nNext comes the USB cables. These will also have their cables run underneath the motherboard. Take the Bottom Camera USB cable and run it to the left across the staging plate, under the motherboard, and out the other side.

Insert M5 Hex Nuts into all four of the hex nut locations on the X gantry back and push into the 3d print.     Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M5x10mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M5x10mm machine screw.\n  Insert two M3 Hex Nuts vertically into the two slots near each side of the print. Insert to more M3 nuts into the two horizontal slots near the bottom edge of the print.\n    Now, onto the front print of the X gantry. Insert M3 Hex Nuts into the six hex nut locations on the X gantry front and push into the 3d print. Also press two M3 nuts into the vertical slots in the back side of the print.        Pull the hex nuts fully into location by screwing a M3x12mm machine screw into them from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M3x12mm machine screw.\n  Insert a M5 nylock nut into the recess at the bottom of the X front gantry.\n    Insert a M5x45mm machine screw into each of the top two holes on the X Gantry Front which have a printed roller spacer. Onto each of the two machine screws, place a roller spacer, then a V-slot roller.    Place the X gantry rear onto the two machine screws    Add a M5 nut onto each of the two machine screws. Tighten the nylon lock nuts on the machine screws so that the two sides are snug against the V-slot rollers.    Place two linear rails onto the front of the X gantry and line up each one with the arrays of three holes on the left and right side. Place three M3x12mm machine screws into each of the rails (the far ends, then one in the middle) and tighten down.    Place the NEMA 17 motor so the shaft runs through the X gantry front and emerges on the same side as the linear rails. Make sure the motor’s connector is pointing towards the umbilical guide as shown in the image. Fasten the NEMA17 motor to the X gantry front using four M3x8mm machine screws.    At the top left of the assembly front, place a limit switch PCB. Fasten the limit switch PCB with two M3x8mm screws.    Place a M5x25mm machine screw through the GT2 idler and into the X gantry front. Secure this machine screw to the gantry by tightening it into M5 nylock nut inserted into the back side. Ensure that the fit is tight and there’s no wiggle in the idler, but also make sure that it can spin freely and isn’t seizing from overtightening.    Now it’s time to mount the Z gantries. Each gantry comes in two parts. The first is a back plate that sits against the linear rail carriage, and connects to the timing belt. These will always be on your machine. Even when you swap toolheads, these will stay attached to the linear rail. On top of these mounts the tool. We’ll be mounting a single Pick Head tool on the left Z gantry. Start by building the Left Z gantry subassembly. Insert four M3x10mm screws through the left z gantry, and then through the left z gantry back plate as shown in the images. Lastly, take the ???? mm strip of GT2 timing belt and slide it into the slot on the back side of the left Z gantry back plate. Ensure that it is perfectly centered along the length of the belt.       TODO(image of gt2 in this slot)\nThen mount the whole stack onto the left linear rail.    Now we’ll get the Z axis timing belt mounted. Start by placing the GT2 Pulley onto the Z motor shaft. Make sure the Z motor mounting hardware is loose and the motor is slid down in its hardware slots as far down as it can go. Feed the GT2 timing belt attached to the left Z carriage around the idler and the pulley. Slide each end of the belt into the right z gantry back plate, with each end meeting in the middle of the print. Slide the Z motor up in its hardware slots and check for belt tension. If you’re able to get the belt completely taut, great! If not, remove the loose ends of the belt, snip off a belt rib from one side, and try again.  TODO(pic of routing the belt around these two) TODO(pic of sliding the ends into the right plate) TODO(pic of checking tension)\nAfter you’re able to achieve proper tension without hitting the end of the Z motor mounting hardware slots, put the right z gantry onto the right z gantry back plate, and screw them into the linear rail gantry using four M3x10mm screws. Next, tighten the GT2 pulley onto the Z motor shaft. Make sure it’s in the correct Y position on the shaft so that it’s in line with the gantries and the idler at the bottom. Lastly, pull upwards on the Z motor until you achieve tension on the belt, then tighten the screws holding it on. Start with the screw at the top of the print, then the bottom, then the two side screws.  TODO(pic of tightening the right z gantry in place with belt) TODO(pic tightening the z pulley) TODO(pic pulling up on z motor and tightening)\nNow that our Z gantries are all tightened and moving freely, we can mount our final axis: rotation! Take your NEMA?? hollow shaft stepper motor, and place it in the left z gantry. Secure it in place with four M2.5x8mm screws.    Now we’ll mount a few bits of hardware to the hollow shaft motor. Screw the CP40 nozzle holder into the bottom side of the motor, and screw the press-fit pneumatic coupler into the top side.    Fit two of the GT2 belt clamps onto the back of the X gantry, and lightly secure them in place with four M5x10mm screws.

Make sure the X motor is on the left side with the front of the X gantry facing you.    Next, we’ll start adding the second set of rollers on the X gantry that hold it onto the rail. Begin by sliding the X gantry tension bars onto the bottom of the X gantry prints. Slide two rollers in between them, ensuring that the holes in them line up with the holes in the X gantry tension bars.      Now we can secure these in place using a couple M5x40mm bolts. Pass them through the holes, and loosely tighten them into two M5 nuts in the slots on the back side of the X gantry. Don’t tighten all the way yet; we still have some adjustment to do first.       Now we add tension screws. These are what hold the X gantry tension bars in the correct position to have proper tension along the rail. Take four M3x30mm screws and pass them through the holes in the tension bars, and thread into the M3 nuts inserted into the front and back panels of the X gantry, as shown below. Make sure each screw is tightened the same amount, and that the X gantry can still move freely, but doesn’t have any wiggle on the rail.       Lastly, we’ll mount the top camera and ring light. First we’ll make the camera subassembly, then mount it to the gantry. Begin by placing the ring light facing downwards into the down light mount. Before we mount the camera into this, we need to loosen the screw holding the lens in place. We’ll need to adjust the focal length after the camera is mounted, so we need to loosen it while we can. Unscrew it just enough such that you can turn the lens in and out. You might need a light grip with pliers to get it to make a full turn; this is ok. After you’ve loosened the lens, place the down camera mount on top, ensuring that the tab from the down light mount fits into the recess. These two prints will pinch the top ring light in place. Lastly, fit the top camera into the down camera mount. Make sure the connector on the back side of the camera is between the two arms of the down camera mount.  TODO(picture of putting the top ring light in the diffusor print)\n     Secure the whole stack in place with four M2.5x20mm screws. Tighten them down so that all parts are tightly held together, but don’t overtorque; these screws are threading into the plastic of a print.    Mount the top camera and light subassembly onto the back of the X gantry using two M3x14mm screws.

Then push a M5x40mm machine screw through the gantry and roller assembly.    Now roll the Y gantry to the very front of the machine. Adjust the fit of the Y gantry extrusion inside the roller assemblies you just made such that the top rollers fit perfectly into the v-slot.

While applying light pressure down on the Y gantry, roll it to the back of the machine. You might find that you need to expand or contract the back legs to have the rollers ride perfectly in the v-slot.
